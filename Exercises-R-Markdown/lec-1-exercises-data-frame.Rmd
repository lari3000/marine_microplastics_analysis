#1 Create the following data frame and name it “exams”.

```{r}
exams <- data.frame(
  student = c("Alice","Sarah","Harry","Ron","Kate"),
  score = c(86,95,87,99,97),
  letter = c("A","B","B","B","A"),
  late = c("FALSE","TRUE","FALSE","FALSE","TRUE"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE )

print(exams)
```

#2 Compute the mean score for this exam and print it.

```{r}
print(paste("The mean score for the exam is", mean(exams$score)))
```

#3 Find the student with the highest score and print the corresponding row of “exams”. Hint: use the function which.max().

```{r}
exams[which.max(exams$score), ]
```
