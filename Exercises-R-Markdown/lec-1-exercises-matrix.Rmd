#1	Create the following 5 by 5 matrix and store it as variable X.

```{r}
X <- matrix(seq(1,25), nrow = 5, byrow = FALSE)
```

#2 Create a matrix Y by adding an independent Gaussian noise  (random numbers) with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 to  each entry of X. e.g.

```{r}
Y <- X + rnorm(X, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

#3 Find the inverse of Y.

```{r}
solve(Y)
```

#4 Show numerically that the matrix product of Y and its inverse is the identity matrix.

```{r}
solve(Y)%*%Y
```
