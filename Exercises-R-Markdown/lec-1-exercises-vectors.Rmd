#1 Generate and print a vector of 10 random numbers between  5 and 500.
```{r}
sample(x = 5:500, size = 10)
```

#2 Generate a random vector Z of 1000 letters (from “a” to “z”).  Hint: the variable letters is already defined in R.
```{r}
Z <- sample(LETTERS, size=1000, replace=TRUE)
print(Z)
```

#3 Print a summary of Z in the form of a frequency table.
```{r}
E <- table(Z)
print(E)
```

#4 Print the list of letters that appear an even number of  times in Z.
```{r}
E[lapply(E, "%%", 2) == 0]
```
